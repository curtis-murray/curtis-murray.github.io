    Hi, I'm Curtis!
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Data Scientist, Mathematician, PhD Candidate, and Energy Market Analyst
with five years of experience in Data Science, I am passionate about using my
expertise to make a positive impact in the world, addressing a diverse set of
critical global challenges from climate change to healthcare.

  </p>
  <p>
    Currently employed full time in the energy sector, I am dedicated to developing
data-driven strategies for the transition to net-zero sustainable energy systems
and climate change mitigation. Concurrently, I am near completion of my
PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Adelaide. My thesis involves
developing and applying Natural Language Processing techniques to social media
data to harness patient reported experiences and reveal a patient perspective on
healthcare. I am a Research Associate at Swinburne University of Technology,
where I use Statistical and Machine Learning techniques to build a model for
prediction of elderly falls from an ambient assisted living system. I have also
provided value to a diverse team of healthcare researchers by applying natural
language processing to analyze adverse event reports. Additionally, I have a strong
background in teaching, having worked as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate
and postgraduate courses in mathematics, statistics, and data science, as well as
a tutor in first-year mathematics help rooms. In 2019 I graduated with a First
Class Honours in Mathematics (Statistics) from The University of Adelaide, and
was awarded a University Medal.
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations
actively seeking to make a positive impact in the world, to create a greener, more
equitable future for all. I welcome connections with those who share my vision
and wish to discuss innovative approaches to problem-solving

    <p>Energy Exemplar</p>
    <p>As an Energy Market Analyst at Energy Exemplar, I am dedicated to addressing
      the global urgency of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and accelerating the
      transition to net-zero energy systems, while ensuring a sustainable energy supply
      for society. My primary responsibilities at Energy Exemplar are: To provide and
      present clients with optimised solutions that allow them to reach their renewable energy targets, and; To develop simulation-ready datasets for entire regions’
      energy infrastructure and network topology. These include historical energy demand and pricing that we use to backcast against, allowing clients to perform
      what-if analyses. To meet these responsibilities, I leverage my PhD background
      in Applied Mathematics and Data Science.</p>

      <p>As a Research Associate at Swinbourne University, I am working on a data science project focused on analyzing HalleyAssist’s ambient assisted living system’s
        sensor data to enhance the safety and well-being of seniors. My research seeks to
        answer the following questions: (1) Can a signal be identified within the sensor
        data that predicts a fall? and (2) How does understanding the likelihood of falls
        occurring contribute to a better comprehension of the components that cause
        falls?</p><br>

    <p>My PhD lies in an intersection of Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Healthcare. Understanding patient experience in healthcare is increasingly important and desired by medical professionals in a patient-centred care approach. Healthcare discourse on social media presents an opportunity to gain a unique perspective on patient-reported experiences, complementing traditional survey data. Harnessing patient reported experiences from this discourse requires modern techniques in Natural Language Processing that can reveal structure from free-text comments. In my PhD I make numerous contributions to this research problem through a series of papers.</p>
